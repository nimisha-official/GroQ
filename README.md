# GroqCloud Integration üéê

### What is GroqCloud?üßê
GroqCloud is a cloud-based inference platform designed to deliver ultra-fast AI model inference with low latency and high performance. It empowers developers to run LLMs (Large Language Models) with blazing-fast speed, making AI applications smoother and scalable. GroqCloud operates on Groq LPU (Language Processing Unit), a specially designed hardware chip that enables real-time AI responses without batching.

#### What is Groq LPU?ü§î
Groq LPU (Language Processing Unit) is a hardware chip specially designed for AI model inference at ultra-fast speeds. It operates as the core engine behind GroqCloud, providing streaming processing instead of traditional batch processing, which allows the platform to deliver real-time AI responses.
##### Examples of Groq LPU Usage:
- Chatbot conversation with instant replies
- Real-time voice-to-text transcription
- Live image captioning
- Quick content summarization

### Key Features üöÄ
- High-speed inference  
- Scalable cloud architecture  
- Low latency execution  
- Easy API integration  
- Supports popular LLMs like LLaMA, GPT, and more  
- Free tier available with **1000 tokens/month**  

### Implementation
1. **Signup & API Key Generation** üîë  
   - Visit [GroqCloud](https://groq.com/) and create an account.  
   - Free users get 1000 requests/day and 100,000 tokens/day.  
   - Generate API Key from dashboard under Free Tier.  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install requests

3. **API Request Example**
```python
import requests

API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
url = 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

payload = {
  "model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768",  # Model naam change kari shake
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello Kanuda, how can GroqCloud help you today?"}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 100
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```
4. **Output Example**
```python
"Hello! I'm just a language model, I don't have any real-world needs or problems. But I can tell you that GroqCloud is a cloud-based platform for running machine learning workloads on Groq's tensor streaming processor (TSP) hardware. GroqCloud allows users to easily provision and manage TSP clusters, and to use a familiar Python API to run their machine learning models. It can help organizations that need to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently"
